# AlphaVantage
A project utilizing the AlphaVantage financial market data set

This project utilizes the https://www.alphavantage.co/ API to return the users request for stock trading data. The first iteration will be to return stock data for specific stocks in a list and deposit that data into an OLTP data store for future analytics.

In future iterations, the goal will be to create a front end app using streamlit as well as a cron workflow to send alerts for specific stocks in a list.
